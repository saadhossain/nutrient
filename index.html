            <p>A whole food plant-based diet is a regimen that emphasises minimally processed plant-based foods and
                discourages the consumption of meat, dairy products and eggs. It is a scientifically proven approach
                that empowers patients to treat and prevent disease, starting in their own kitchens. </p>

                <h3>Fresh Vegetables</h3>
                <p>Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other animals as food. The original
                    meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant
                    matter, including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds.</p>

                <h3>Fresh Fruits</h3>
                <p>Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds.
                    Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a
                    symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition.</p>
